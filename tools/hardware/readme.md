# Hardware

- Everybody who writes code needs a big monitor.
  - If you're not able to view scripts side-by-side, there is a disincentive to break up code into modules. (Already hard to take the time, so we shouldn't impose any extra barriers).
  - When we share our screen, we shouldn't have to worry about vastly different screen sizes. (MB shouldn't have to settle on the lowest common denominator, i.e. a 13 inch laptop screen.)
- If team feels whiteboarding is beneficial: You can easily do this remotely if you give everyone a small touchscreen that enables drawing with a stylus.
- docking station: expensive, but totally worth it for a laptop. Needing to plug in/unplug only a single cable is key to not losing the flexibility a laptop affords you. If you instead have to speperately connect multiple monitors, power plug, plus a host of other peripherals (Keyboard, mouse, speaker, WebCam,â€¦), this acts as a huge deterrent for bringing your laptop with you when moving around.
