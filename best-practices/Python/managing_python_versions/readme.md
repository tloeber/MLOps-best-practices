# Problem

Unfortunately, installing different Python versions on the same machine can lead to conflicts. See, e.g., [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocols.html#predefined-protocols) for a discussion. The particular issue I encountered is described [here](https://bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/pip/2022/02/21/vendored-six.html).

# Solutions
