## Mac vs PC (vs Linux)

- Challenge: switching has big impact on productivity, in particular for developers, since they tend to rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts for productivity
- Implications:
  - If at all possible, give employees a choice over desired OS.
  - if standardization is required, make this as easy as possible:
    - Collect pain points developers usually face in switching, and crowd-source solutions in company wiki
      - In particular, how can we make productivity shortcuts less platform-dependent? See [here](../../../../productivity/keyboard-shortcuts/readme.md) for my approach.
      - Mac:
        - Swap `cmd` and `ctrl` modifiers for a more Windows/Ubuntu-like experience.
        - Due to the lower customizability of shortcuts on MacOS, we **need a third-party program** (e.g., Carabiner) for customizing remaining shortcuts. While we generally don't want developers to install random programs, it is essential that we approve a program for remapping keyboard shortcuts, since these are essential for developer productivity.
