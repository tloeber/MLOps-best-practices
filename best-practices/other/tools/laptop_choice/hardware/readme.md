# Hardware
- Everybody who writes code needs a big monitor.
	+ If you're not able to view scripts side-by-side, there is a disincentive to break up code into modules. (Already hard to take the time, so we shouldn't impose any extra barriers).
	+ When we share our screen, we shouldn't have to worry about vastly different screen sizes. (MB shouldn't have to settle on the lowest common denominator, i.e. a 13 inch laptop screen.)
- If team feels whiteboarding is beneficial: You can easily do this remotely if you give everyone a small touchscreen that enables drawing with a stylus.
- docking station: expensive, but totally worth it for a laptop. Needing to plug in/unplug only a single cable is key to not losing the flexibility a laptop affords you. If you instead have to speperately connect multiple monitors, power plug, plus a host of other peripherals (Keyboard, mouse, speaker, WebCam,â€¦), this acts as a huge deterrent for bringing your laptop with you when moving around.

## Mac vs PC (vs Linux)
- Challenge: switching has big impact on productivity, in particular for developers, since they tend to rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts for productivity
- Implications:
  - If at all possible, give employees a choice over desired OS.
  - if standardization is required, make this as easy as possible:
    - Collect pain points developers usually face in switching, and crowd-source solutions in company wiki
      - In particular, how can we make productivity shortcuts less platform-dependent?
      - Mac: 
        - Swap `cmd` and `ctrl` modifiers for a more Windows (and Ubuntu)-like experience.
        - Need a third-party program (e.g., Carabiner) for customizing remaining shortcuts, since inbuilt customization is limited (while we generally don't want developers to install random programs, it is essential that we approve a program for remapping keyboard shortcuts, since these are essential for developer productivity).
