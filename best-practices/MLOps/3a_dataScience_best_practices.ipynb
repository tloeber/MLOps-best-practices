    "# *Data science* best practices\n",
    "## Must-haves\n",
    "### 1) Background infra / team investment ~~/ Environment / Ecosystem~~\n",
    "- Quick & easy dev setup\n",
    "  - Align incentives: The recommended way should be the easy way. \n",
    "    - Don't just write up the required setup steps in a readme â€“ instead, put them in a script whenever possible! [Makefiles are ideals for this](./_details/why_makefiles.md).\n",
    "  - This is most efficiently solved by a central (company-wide) ML infrastructure team, so that each team does not have to reinvent the wheel. However, were such a central team does not yet exist, this task can easily be handled by ML engineers. (In the latter case, this is a good candidate for scaling the solution develop to other teams, once the benefits can be demonstrated.)\n",
    "  - Try to leverage *managed* services, rather than re-inventing the wheel! Instead, focus on company's core competencies. Most companies underinvest in this because:\n",
    "    - They systematically mis-estimate the relative cost of build versus buy because they:\n",
    "      - are overly focused on the additional expenses of managed services, while not sufficiently taking into account the value of engineers' time that this frees up;\n",
    "      - tend to underestimate the cost of building the solution in house, because they don't efficiently account for the risk of unknown unknowns ([\"planning fallacy\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy));\n",
    "    - If there is an internal team currently providing these services, these internal stakeholders may influence disproportionate influence on decision-making. (It is a well-known phenomenon in the social sciences that in cases where gains are concentrated but losses are distributed across a wider range of individuals, the former have much larger incentive to advocate for their side, which often leads to suboptimal\n",
    "- Availability of tooling to:\n",
    "  - Use the explorative notebook workflow without forgoing the benefits of an IDE (e.g., syntax highlighting, code completion, easy display of documentation such as parameter names of a function, ability to use powerful plugins such as GitHub Co-Pilot, etc)\n",
    "    - Reliable solution to run Notebook in IDE (VSCode support for notebooks is borderline as of late 2023 - net positive in my opinion but still a lot of bugs, though no dealbreakers)\n",
    "    - Promising alternative: JetBrains Datalore. Managed notebook environment with a lot of additional features (in particular, inbuilt visualization of data frames, similar to what DataBricks does for Spark; feature for collaboration and sharing of interactive reports). Need to evaluate in more detail if it is worth the cost, but if it has less bugs than VSCode, the time it saves data scientists should easily outweigh the subscription cost.\n",
    "  - manage the complexity that arises out of the *explorative* workflow \n",
    "    - In particular, a solution for experiment management (e.g., MLFlow). A model registry also falls into this category, as it serves to mark which of the many trained models have passed a quality threshold that makes them fit for deployment.\n",
    "  - deal with *data versioning*\n",
    "    - For basic use cases, Data Version Control may be a good enough starting point.\n",
    "    - If the data has an important time-series component, the ability to time-travel (e.g., retrieve a snapshot of how the data looked like at a given point in time) becomes essential in order to avoid information leakage, which is a common source of training-serving skew.\n",
    "      - This functionality could come from either:\n",
    "        - the underlying data infrastructure (e.g. it is available in Snowflake, DeltaLake, Apache Iceberg tables, or any system based on event-sourcing); or\n",
    "        - a dedicated feature store.\n",
    "    - If the underlying data infrastructure does not allow implementing time-travel functionality, we may need to work around this in the short term by:\n",
    "      - Making sure the data science team has the right time-series expertise in order to deal with these complications manually; and\n",
    "      - We need to communicate to the business side what limitations we incur until our underlying data infrastructure supports time-travel:\n",
    "        - *Which kinds of questions we won't be able to answer,* except at great cost (e.g., \"Can you show me what the model would have predicted last January when we had this and that problem going on...\")\n",
    "        - Greater risk of training-serving skew;\n",
    "        - Slower pace of feature delivery;\n",
    "        - Greater cost: Need for more advanced skills.\n",
    "- Safety to experiment\n",
    "  - This is analogous to the importance of psychological safety at the team level.\n"

    "- Coding standards:\n",
    "  - Python:\n",
    "    - auto-format code  (but don't spend much time worrying about details)\n",
    "      - The reason I consider this a must-have, even though it may not seem like the most important best practice, is that it is a *quick win,* delivering outsized benefits relative to the small amount of work required. Often, it will be possible to simply borrow the setup that ML engineers already have. If not, remember that any autoformatter is better than none, so just pick one and get started! \n",
    "      - At the latest, auto-formatting should be run by pipeline on merge.\n",
    "      - It may also make sense to have the IDE auto-format files on save, because this instant feedback is a great way to teach data scientists how to write better code in the first place. However, it is crucial that IDE and pipeline apply the *same* rules (e.g., are configured from the same .pylintrc file). \n",
    "      - Rationale: Ensure  consistency; *enforce* best practices, such as optimizing for readability and avoiding surprising or error-prone constructs. A lot has already been written about this topic; see for example [the excellent discussion in \"Software Engineering at Google\"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch08.html). \n",
    "      - Data-science specific modifications:\n",
    "        - Since data scientists tend to be less interested in learning the details of a programming language, we need to find a process that does not require them to spend much time on mastering the rules. Therefore, the *easiest solution is usually to simply set up automatic code formatting* (e.g., using auto-pep8, black, yapf, etc). This reduces the effort to a one-time set up, which can be handled by the engineering team.\n",
    "        - Generally, we want to align with engineering team on using the same formatting standards (same config file). If handoff from data science to engineering is based on branching (i.e., commits flow from data science branch to an engineering branch), we could technically apply a different set of formatting rules at that point. However, unless there is a clear reason why there are different formatting needs, it is better to avoid this to simplify the process and increase consistency of the code base.\n",
    "  - Notebook/Data-science-specific:\n",
    "    - Clean up notebook before merging: It is natural that notebooks get messy from the explorative data science workflow. This is not a problem in itself, but the key is to eventually distill the essential insights into a more easily digestible form. The right time to do so is when merging to mainline, because this is when the work will be shared with other people, who need to be able to understand it with the least possible cognitive overhead.\n",
    "      - Remove duplication, e.g. resulting from copy-pasting cells and running similar transformations/training with different parameters. If we want to store the results from different experiments, this should be handled by experiment management solution such as MLFlow.\n",
    "      - Decide what we want to keep around, and what can be deleted. (If in doubt, it is probably fine to delete. While it is always tempting to keep code around \"just in case\", this increases the cognitive load on the future reader and detracts from the main insights.)\n",
    "    - Ensure notebook output cells reflect a run from top to bottom. \n",
    "      - This is not easy if notebook includes expensive calculations, which makes it impractical to simply restart kernel and then re-run whole notebook before committing. \n",
    "      - There are some tools that are supposed to help with this, but I have not looked into them.\n",
    "      - [The best solution may be to simply limit the use of notebooks beyond the initial experimentation phase](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/68282.html).\n",

    "    - However, Continuous Integration (i.e., merging code to mainline at least once a day) is NOT generally a good fit for the explorative data science workflow. This is because notebooks require a good amount of cleanup before it makes sense to merge (see \"team processes/coding standards\" above).\n",

    "    - For short-lived notebooks, it is usually sufficient to track *either* abstract or concrete dependencies.\n",

    "      - At the very latest, this should be done before producing anything (code, data, models) that may be used in production. For example, it's ok to run experiments on a small subset of the data, where the main purpose is to get the code to work, but where any parameter estimates will be discarded.\n",
