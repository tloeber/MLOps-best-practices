# How to organize best practices?

## Open questions

- Is organizing by must-haves versus should-haves the best idea?
- Where do we draw the line between must- versus should-have?
- How do we deal with differences in degree rather than differences in kind? For example, a basic amount of clean code is clearly a must-have for ML engineering, but some aspects of it may only be should- or even would-like-to haves.
- How do best practices differ by:
  - use case (e.g., inherent complexity of data transformations and ML modeling)?
  - POC versus production?

## Alternatives

- ~~by maturity level~~
  - Corresponds to must-/should-/would-like-to-haves: Low maturity corresponds to not having any; medium maturity corresponds to having must-haves, high corresponds to additionally satisfying should-haves, and highest corresponds to also satisfying would-like-to-haves.
- Should we specify which are the minimum requirements once we enter production? Or could just use color-coding!
