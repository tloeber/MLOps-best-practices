- Decision to make: Is linking to external resources enough, or do need to summarize etc.?
- Preliminary decision: Only summarize/copy if:
	- Something has become a problem for the team (so we want to emphasize corresponding standard)
	- Not available publicly for free (e.g., design pattern book)
	- Original text does not contain quick summarization
	- Original text is unclear/excessively complicated, or we have extra points to include.
