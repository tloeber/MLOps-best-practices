* Onboarding
- Since we are often forced to hire people with general rather than specific skills, we need to 
  make sure that they acquire the job specific skills ASAP. Thus, we need to document both the 
  expectations what everyone on the team should know, and useful resources to acquire 
  this knowledge.
- Language and tool specific skills
  - Automated testing, potentially TDD, etc.
* Leveraging your IDE's most important features:
	- static code analysis, especially type checking. Linting.
	- Git GUI
		- When  it makes sense to use a CLI-based tool, and when a GUI is preferable. Obviously, this partly depends on people's preferences, but since opinions on the subject tend to be pretty strong, it is worth putting down some general principles.
	- How to use a proper debugger

	- The expectation is that it should be easy to onboard simply using configuration as code. If something does not work as intended, the expectation on the new engineer is to update the documentation to handle the reason why it did not work initially. (Create a pull request, which may then lead to a discussion of the underlying problems â€“ did something change, or do we need to handle a new case?). Continually investing a little bit of effort to keep this configuration up to date is the only way to keep it from slowly decaying Until it eventually becomes useless!
- Document expectations for clarity, consistency, and more efficient onboarding.
- For example, when you're unavailable for a couple of hours for a doctor's appointment, do you just block your calendar, set the time slot is unavailable on your calendar (to automatically decline meetings and alert the organizer that your out of office at that time), or do you also put those times into a shared calendar? (If the latter, team calendar or just individuals you frequently collaborate with?) And at what point do you have to check with manager or colleagues before you take days off?
